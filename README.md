Hibernate Criteria Query Language (HCQL) is a programmatic, object-oriented way to query a database in Hibernate. It allows developers to build complex queries dynamically using a fluent API, eliminating the need to write SQL. HCQL supports features like filtering, projections,  and joins while maintaining database independence and type safety.
